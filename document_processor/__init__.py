# This file makes 'document_processor' a Python package.
# It can be empty.

# You can optionally expose certain things at the package level here, for example:
# from .src.orchestrator import process_docx_document, process_pdf_document
# from .src.file_handler import read_docx_text, read_pdf_text
# ... and so on for other key functions/classes you want easily accessible.

# For now, keeping it simple and relying on more specific imports in `main.py` (like `from .src.orchestrator import ...`)
# or in other modules (like `from document_processor.src.module import ...` if `document_processor` parent is in PYTHONPATH).
